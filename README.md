Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (Python + Power BI)

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to identify the key drivers of customer attrition for a telecommunications company. By combining Python's statistical power with Power BI's interactive visualization, I developed a solution that not only describes what happened but also identifies the underlying factors of customer loss.


🛠️ Tech Stack
Python: Data Cleaning (Pandas), Statistical Analysis, and Advanced Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib).

Power BI: Data Modeling (Star Schema) and Interactive Dashboarding.

DAX: Business Metrics (Churn Rate %, Revenue at Risk, Total Customers).


🔄 Workflow
Data Cleaning (Python): Handled missing values in TotalCharges, converted data types, and encoded categorical variables for correlation analysis.

Statistical Discovery: Integrated a Python Correlation Matrix (Heatmap) directly into Power BI to visualize relationships between features like contract type, tenure, and churn.

Data Modeling: Designed a robust model in Power BI to ensure filter efficiency and scalability.

Dashboarding: Created an executive-level report focusing on actionable insights.


📊 Key Findings & Recommendations
Insight: High churn is concentrated in customers with Fiber Optic service and month-to-month contracts.

Recommendation: Launch a loyalty program to migrate "at-risk" customers from monthly to annual plans.

Recommendation: Investigate technical performance or pricing competitiveness of the Fiber Optic segment.
